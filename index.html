            I knew from a young age that I wanted to be an engineer. As a child instead of playing with my toys the way a normal child would I use to take the toys apart to see how they worked and understand the innards. As a teenager, I saved up enough to buy my first car a 1998 GTI VW I took the entire car apart and rebuilt the motor while adding some other features too. There was always this curiosity that I had about how things worked weather it be in nature or man made. I do enough the theoretical aspect of physics and engineering but I also had a passion to build things that were practical rather than purely theoretical, because of this I decided to study electrical engineer. Figuration college was a humbling experience because I was the first on in my family to do so and also because I realized I still have so much to learn. I am always learning everyday and I think more than anything schooling as taught me how to focuses, teach myself, and how to apply what I've learned.
