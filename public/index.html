          <div class="titletext"> Hello, my name is Kevin Duarte and this is my personal website. I am an electrical and software
            engineer, designer, photographer, problem solver, and a student of life. But above all else I
            am a passionate individual with the desire to connect and work
            with others on meaningful projects. I'm currently looking for Front-End Developer Positions ! </div>

          <div class="text2"> Software Engineer, 2018 </div>
          <div class="text3"> I've always had an interest in software and the tech industry. In college I took a few
            intro to programing classes and worked often in matlab. I started to teach myself some web technologies
            (html, css, and javascript) shortly after graduating college but I wanted to accelerate my learning to the
            next level and also learn more about the new cutting edge technologies and libraries out today. Fullstack
            provided me that opportunity and so much more.

            I knew from a young age that I wanted to be an engineer. As a child instead of playing with my toys the way
            a normal child would I use to take the toys apart to see how they worked and understand the innards. As a
            teenager, I saved up enough to buy my first car and I took the entire car apart and rebuilt the
            motor while adding some other features too. There was always this curiosity that I had about how things
            worked. I do enjoy the theoretical aspect of physics and engineering
            but I also have a passion to build things that are practical this is why I decided to study electrical engineering. Finishing college was a humbling experience for me because I was the first one in my family to do so and also because I realized I still have so much to learn and I'm always learning everyday.

            TDKs products from the factory to the customer in a timely manner.I've worked with companies like Tesla who
